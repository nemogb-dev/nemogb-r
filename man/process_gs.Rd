\title{Process Gradescope Data}
\usage{
process_gs(gs, drop_ungraded = TRUE, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{gs}{A Gradescope dataframe with students as rows and assignment information across the columns.}

\item{drop_ungraded}{Whether or not to drop ungraded assignments}

\item{verbose}{Whether or not to print messages and warnings}
}
\value{
Gradescope dataframe, optionally with all ungraded assignments removed
}
\description{
This function processes the Gradescope data before grading. Ungraded assignments
(i.e. assignments with all NAs for their scores) can optionally be dropped.
Eventually, this will also merge duplicated students and deal with students with no SID.
