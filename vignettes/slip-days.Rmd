Slip days are a unique grading policy, where there is an allotted budget of allowed lateness that can be applied to certain assignments. Here's an example of what that looks like in a policy file. Note that `slip_days` are their own separate section in the grading policy and do no fall under the other `categories` grading criteria. Often, slip days are computed prior to applying other grading policies because they adjust the lateness.
```yaml
`r xfun::file_string(system.file("extdata", "slip-days-policy-demo.yaml", package = "nemogb"))`

```
In this policy, there are 2 allotted slip days for the six Lab assignments. This means that students can turn in Lab assignments up to 2 days late with no additional lateness penalty applied. Usually, these slip days are allotted chronologically, so if a student turns in Lab 1 2 days late, they do not have any more slip days that can be used for later Lab assignments. Similarly, if a student turned in Lab 1 a day late, they can still turn in one of the other labs at most a day late with no penalty. Lateness is rounded up to the next day, so a student will use a slip day if their assignment is turned in 1 minute late or 23 hours late.

The `order` key here explicitly determines that the order in which slip days are allotted is `chronological`. This is the default if there was no `order` key is provided. Another accepted key is `given`, which allocates slip days based on the order given in the policy file in `assignments` under `slipdays` with no regard to the chronological order of these assignments.

The lateness policy for `Labs` in `categories` section shows that any late assignments receive a zero. This is applied after a student's slip days run out.

The process for computing the grades using `nemogb` is the same as any other policy file, as demonstrated below.
```{r setup}
library(nemogb)
gs <- read_gs(system.file("extdata", "gs_demo.csv", package = "nemogb"))
policy <- read_policy(system.file("extdata", "slip-days-policy-demo.yaml", package = "nemogb"))
grades <- get_grades(gs, policy)
```

Here is what the grades look like:
```{r, echo = FALSE}
grades |>
  knitr::kable()
```

Note that there is also a column called "Slip Days 1", which shows how much of their "slip-days budget" each student has used up.

Here is a before-and-after comparison of how students' lateness are updated after applying slip days.
```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
labs <- c("Lab 1", "Lab 2", "Lab 3", "Lab 4", "Lab 5", "Lab 6")
score_and_late_cols <- paste0(rep(labs, each = 2), c("", " - Lateness (H:M:S)"))
gs |>
  select(all_of(c("SID", score_and_late_cols))) |>
  knitr::kable()
grades |>
  select(all_of(c("SID", score_and_late_cols, "Remaining: Slip Days 1"))) |>
  knitr::kable()
```
Note that majority of late submissions were within the allotted "slip day budget," but the last student had additional lateness in Lab 5. This means that, in the final grades results, this student will receive a zero on this assignment as a resulting penalty.
