```

Now, we will walk through a simple syllabus and its `nemogb` implementation with 5 students in the class. Let's start with what this syllabus would look like on a class website:

## Syllabus

The final student's grade is computed from *1) homework assignments, 2) midterm and 3) the final exam*. Their grade will be computed as follows:

-   Homework 20%
    -   Homework 1, Homework 2 (and they are aggregated equally)
-   Midterm 40%
-   Final Exam 40%

## Policy File

Here is what the policy file looks like:

``` yaml
`r xfun::file_string(system.file("extdata", "simple_syllabus.yaml", package = "nemogb"))`
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(nemogb)
read_policy(system.file("extdata", "simple_syllabus.yaml", package = "nemogb"))
```

## Gradescope Assigments File

Here is what the Gradescope assignments file looks like:

::: {style="height: 500px; overflow: auto;"}
```{r, message=FALSE}
simple_syllabus_data <- read_gs(system.file("extdata", "simple_syllabus_data.csv", package = "nemogb"))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(simple_syllabus_data)
```
:::

## Workflow

**Overall grade** is calculated using the three categories, with the weights as shown above; This is represented by `Overall Grade` with an aggregation of `weighted_mean`.

The **Midterm** and **Final Exam** categories contain only a single assignment, as shown in the `simple_syllabus_data` file, which is usually downloaded from Gradescope.

The **Homework** category is compiled of two assignments: *"Homework 1"* and *"Homework 2"* in the `simple_syllabus_data`.

### Grade Calculations

```{r, message=FALSE}
simple_syllabus_data <- read_gs(system.file("extdata", "simple_syllabus_data.csv", package = "nemogb"))

policy <- read_policy(system.file("extdata", "simple_syllabus.yaml", package = "nemogb"))

grades <- get_grades(gs = simple_syllabus_data, policy = policy)
```

First, read in your YAML policy file. `read_policy()` and `read_gs()` read in their respective files and check for correct formatting. Finally, `get_grades()` computes your assignment grades based on your policy file.

The output of the grades looks like:

::: {style="height: 300px; overflow: auto;"}
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(grades)
```
:::

## Syllabus as a Grading Script
Here is the coded version of the same syllabus.
```{r}
script_grades <- simple_syllabus_data |>
  # calculate percentages
  dplyr::mutate(
    `Homework 1` = `Homework 1`/`Homework 1 - Max Points`,
    `Homework 2` = `Homework 2`/`Homework 2 - Max Points`,
    `Midterm Exam` = `Midterm Exam`/`Midterm Exam - Max Points`,
    `Final Exam` = `Final Exam`/`Final Exam - Max Points`
  ) |>
  # calculate category grade for "Homework" 
  dplyr::mutate( `Homework` = (`Homework 1` + `Homework 2`)/2 ) |>
  # calculate final Overall Grade
  dplyr::mutate(`Overall Grade` = 0.2*`Homework` + 0.4*`Midterm Exam` + 0.4*`Final Exam`) 
```

And, as you can see, the computations align.

```{r, echo= FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(x = script_grades$`Overall Grade`, grades$`Overall Grade`, 
     xlab = "Script Grades", ylab = "NemoGB Grades", cex = 2, pch = 20,
     main = "Alignment of Script and NemoGB Grades"
  )
abline(a = 0, b = 1, col = "red")

if (!all(script_grades$`Overall Grade` == grades$`Overall Grade`))
  stop("Script grades and NemoGB grades do not align for simple syllabus vignette.")
```


### Disclaimers:

-   The `weight` of a category with aggregation `weighted_mean` should be corresponding order with the `assignments.`

-   Categories cannot have the same name as any other assignment name.
