Now, we will walk through a moderately complex syllabus and its `NemoGB` implementation with 5 students in the class. Let's start with what this syllabus would look like on a class website.

## Syllabus


The final student's grade is computed from *1) homework assignments, 2) midterm exam, and 3) the final exam*. Their grade will be computed as follows:

-   Homework 20%
    - Homework 1, Homework 2, Homework 3, Homework 4, Homework 5
    - All assignments are aggregated equally
    - The lowest 2 assignments are dropped
    - All components of the lab individually experience a lateness penalty:
      - 10% reduction of the score, if assignment is submitted late but within 24 hours of the deadline
      - 30% reduction of the score, if assignment is submitted after 24 hours of the deadline
-   Midterm 40%
-   Final Exam 40%


## Policy File 
Here is what the policy file looks like:
```yaml
`r xfun::file_string(system.file("extdata", "moderate_syllabus.yaml", package = "nemogb"))`

```

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(nemogb)
read_policy(system.file("extdata", "moderate_syllabus.yaml", package = "nemogb"))
```

## Gradescope Assigments File
Here is what the Gradescope assignments file looks like:

::: {style="height: 500px; overflow: auto;"}
```{r, message=FALSE}
moderate_syllabus_data <- read_gs(system.file("extdata", "moderate_syllabus_data.csv", package = "nemogb"))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(moderate_syllabus_data)
```
:::

## Workflow

**Overall grade** is calculated using the three categories, with the weights as shown above; This is represented by `Overall Grade` with an aggregation of `weighted_mean`.

The **Midterm** and **Final Exam** categories contain only a single assignment, as shown in the `moderate_syllabus_data` file, which is usually downloaded from gradescope.

The **Homework** category is compiled of five assignments: *"Homework 1"*, *"Homework 2"*, *"Homework 3"*, *"Homework 4"*, *"Homework 5"* in the `moderate_syllabus_data`.

### Grade Calculations

```{r, message = FALSE}
moderate_syllabus_data <- read_gs(system.file("extdata", "moderate_syllabus_data.csv", package = "nemogb"))

policy <- read_policy(system.file("extdata", "moderate_syllabus.yaml", package = "nemogb"))

grades <- get_grades(policy = policy, gs = moderate_syllabus_data)
```
First, read in your YAML policy file. `process_policy()` checks the formatting of the policy file. Then,`reconcile_policy_with_gs()` checks for compatibility between the Gradescope file (`moderate_syllabus_data`) and the policy file (`policy`). Finally, `get_grades()` grades your assignments based on your policy file.

The output of the grades looks like:

::: {style="height: 300px; overflow: auto;"}
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(grades)
```

## Syllabus as a Grading Script
Here is the coded version of the same syllabus.
```{r}
#function to convert HH:MM:SS into minutes
convert_to_min <- function(hms){
  purrr::map_vec(hms, function(time){
    units <- stringr::str_split(time, pattern = ":") |>
      unlist() |>
      as.numeric()
    sum(units*c(60,1,1/60))
  })
}

# function to implement lateness policy
lateness_penalty <- function(score_vec, lateness_vec){
  lateness <- convert_to_min(lateness_vec)
  dplyr::case_when(
    lateness == 0 ~ score_vec,
    lateness <= 1440 ~ 0.9*score_vec,
    .default = 0.7*score_vec
  )
}

#function to drop lowest two grades
two_drops <- function(data){
  apply(dplyr::select(data, `Homework 1`, `Homework 2`, `Homework 3`, `Homework 4`,`Homework 5`), 1, function(x) sort(x, decreasing = TRUE)[1:3]) |> t()
}

data_with_lateness <- moderate_syllabus_data |>
  # calculate percentages
  dplyr::mutate(
    `Homework 1` = `Homework 1`/`Homework 1 - Max Points`,
    `Homework 2` = `Homework 2`/`Homework 2 - Max Points`,
    `Homework 3` = `Homework 3`/`Homework 3 - Max Points`,
    `Homework 4` = `Homework 4`/`Homework 4 - Max Points`,
    `Homework 5` = `Homework 5`/`Homework 5 - Max Points`,
    `Midterm Exam` = `Midterm Exam`/`Midterm Exam - Max Points`,
    `Final Exam` = `Final Exam`/`Final Exam - Max Points`
  ) |>
  #lateness
  dplyr::mutate(
    `Homework 1` = lateness_penalty(`Homework 1`,`Homework 1 - Lateness (H:M:S)`),
    `Homework 2` = lateness_penalty(`Homework 2`,`Homework 2 - Lateness (H:M:S)`),
    `Homework 3` = lateness_penalty(`Homework 3`,`Homework 3 - Lateness (H:M:S)`),
    `Homework 4` = lateness_penalty(`Homework 4`,`Homework 4 - Lateness (H:M:S)`),
    `Homework 5` = lateness_penalty(`Homework 5`,`Homework 5 - Lateness (H:M:S)`)
  ) 
script_grades <- data_with_lateness |>
  # calculate category grade for "Homework" 
  dplyr::mutate( 
    `Homework` = rowMeans(two_drops(data_with_lateness))) |>
  # calculate final Overall Grade
  dplyr::mutate(`Overall Grade` = 0.4*`Homework` + 0.2*`Midterm Exam` + 0.4*`Final Exam`) 
```

And, as you can see, the computations align.
```{r, echo= FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(x = script_grades$`Overall Grade`, grades$`Overall Grade`, 
     xlab = "Script Grades", ylab = "NemoGB Grades", cex = 2, pch = 20,
     main = "Alignment of Script and NemoGB Grades"
  )
abline(a = 0, b = 1, col = "red")

if (!all(script_grades$`Overall Grade` == grades$`Overall Grade`))
  stop("Script grades and NemoGB grades do not align for moderate syllabus vignette.")
```


### Disclaimers:

-   The `weight` of a category with aggregation `weighted_mean` should be corresponding order with the `assignments.`

-   Categories cannot have the same name as any other assignment name.
