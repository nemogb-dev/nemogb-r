[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/687739822.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17546945)

An R package to make course grade calculations easy, fast, and most
importantly, correct. Course grades are produced from a data frame of
assignment grades along with a grading policy file that allows for
accurate and systematic computations of the final course letter grades.
This R package also functions as the backend of the [NemoGB Shiny
app](https://github.com/nemogb-dev/nemogb-app.git), which lets the which
lets the user create their grading policy file in a straightforward way.

### Installation Instructions

To install `nemogb`, make sure to install `devtools` first. The
`pkgdown` website for this version is at
[nemogb-dev.github.io/nemogb-r/](https://nemogb-dev.github.io/nemogb-r/).

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nemogb-dev/nemogb-r@main")
library(nemogb)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Example Usage

Load in your Gradescope data using
[`read_gs()`](https://github.com/nemogb-dev/nemogb-r/reference/read_gs.md).

``` r
library(nemogb)
gs_data <- read_gs(fs::path_package("nemogb", "extdata", "gs_demo.csv"))
```

Start by building a policy file that reflects the assignments from your
Gradescope file and the structure of the syllabus. More information and
guidance on building your policy file in YAML format can be found in the
[Building a Policy File
vignette](https://nemogb-dev.github.io/nemogb-r/articles/policy-files.html).

This YAML policy file should be loaded in with
[`read_policy()`](https://github.com/nemogb-dev/nemogb-r/reference/read_policy.md),
and then course grades can be computed with
[`get_grades()`](https://github.com/nemogb-dev/nemogb-r/reference/get_grades.md).

``` r
policy <- read_policy(fs::path_package("nemogb", "extdata", "policy_demo.yaml"))

grades <- get_grades(policy = policy, gs = gs_data)
```
